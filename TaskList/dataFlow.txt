DATA FLOW ARCHITECTURE
Recommended Flow:

Components → Call hooks for data operations
Hooks → Implement business logic, call context methods
Context → Manage global state, call services
Services → Handle external API operations
Types → Provide type safety throughout
Utils → Support pure utility operations

Key Principles:

Each layer has single responsibility
Data flows unidirectionally
Pure functions where possible
Clear separation of concerns
Consistent error handling patterns
